# Of the Month Subscription Program Readme

## Introduction
This is a simple C# console application that allows users to subscribe to different products with various subscription options and shipping methods. The program calculates the total cost of subscriptions, applies discounts based on the total cost, calculates tax, and provides a final cost breakdown.

## Getting Started
To run this program, you will need to have C# installed on your computer. You can use an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio or simply compile and run the program from the command line.

1. Clone or download the source code from the repository.
2. Open the source code in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Build and run the program.

## How to Use the Program
1. When you run the program, it will display a welcome message and prompt you to enter your first and last name.

2. You will then be asked to select a subscription option from the following:
   - Press 1 for Ice Cream subscription at $12 a month.
   - Press 2 for Bacon subscription at $15 a month.
   - Press 3 for Peanut Butter subscription at $17 a month.

3. Next, choose a shipping method:
   - Press 1 for regular shipping at $5 a month.
   - Press 2 for expedited shipping at $10 a month.
   - Press 3 for overnight shipping at $30 a month.

4. Enter the number of months you would like to have the subscription.

5. The program will calculate the total cost for your subscriptions, apply discounts if applicable, and calculate tax.

6. It will then display a breakdown of the total cost, discount, cost after discount, tax, and the final total cost after tax.

7. After completing the transaction, the program will ask if you want to add another subscription. If you choose "Y" or "y", you can add more subscriptions. If you choose any other input, the program will end, and you will receive a thank-you message.

## Discounts
The program applies discounts based on the total cost of subscriptions:
- If the total cost is over $150, you receive a 10% discount.
- If the total cost is over $100, you receive a 7% discount.
- If the total cost is over $50, you receive a 5% discount.
